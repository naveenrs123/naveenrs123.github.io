This is a personal website for me to showcase my work, and essentially acts as an online version of my resum√©. 

## Technologies Used
I have coded this website using HTML, CSS and small amounts of Javascript/JQuery. JQuery was used to implement smooth scrolling behaviour with appropriate offsets and to animate the opening of the details in the project section.

I frequently used flexbox to style my website due to its versatility and powerful positioning features. 

It is currently quite simple, but I am redo this website using Front-End Framework like React.js for a richer experience.
