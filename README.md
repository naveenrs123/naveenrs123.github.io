This is a personal website for me to showcase my work, and essentially acts as an online version of my resum√©. 

## Technologies Used
I have coded this website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and small amounts of Javascript/JQuery. JQuery was used to implement smooth scrolling behaviour and support the use of Bootstrap.

I frequently used CSS Flexbox to style my website due to its versatility and powerful positioning features. 

It is currently quite simple, but I will likely redo this website at a later date using a Frontend framework like Angular for a richer experience.
